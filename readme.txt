Quick tips. Press Alt + E, run around for a bit and the bot will lay some navnodes. Press Alt + E again to stop. Click "Pick" to select a mob, then press DEL key and off you go. Make sure to check melee mode and bowmode if you need it. Settings.ini has values for the slots and other stuff that you can set yourself. Just restart the bot when changing Settings.ini. Lastly, for the magic/aura slots, they first slot is slot 0, second is slot 1, I have the melee aura in your settings.ini set to slot 4, which is the 5th slot, so stick your aura in the 5th slot which is the first slot of the second row. Read the link I gave you for more info on mob to node values etc.
